# Description
The purpose of Cornell Events is to eaasily access and house all 
Cornell clubs and their events. Features include the ability to 
view all clubs, view all the events hosted by a club, add yourself 
as a club leader or club member, create an event, and edit an event.

# Requirements
Backend:
Cornell Events addresses Backend requirements by designing an API, 
using databases to organize and differentiate Users, Clubs, and Events,
and using association tables to further organize a user by member or
leader. Additionally, our code is deployed to Google Cloud. 
To connect Backend and iOS, we used the get_all_clubs() function and 
get_event_from_club() function which returns all the events associated 
with a club. 

iOS:
Cornell Events addresses iOS requirements by creating an AutoLayout using 
NSLayoutConstraint, using UICollentionView and UITableView, a navigation 
panel at the bottom of the app that navigates between Cornell Clubs and 
Personal, and integration with Backend API.
